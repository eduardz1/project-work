# abstract = {The Split algorithm is an essential building block of route-first cluster-second heuristics and modern genetic algorithms for vehicle routing problems. The algorithm is used to partition a solution, represented as a giant tour without occurrences of the depot, into separate routes with minimum cost. As highlighted by the recent survey of Prins et al. [18], no less than 70 recent articles use this technique. In the vehicle routing literature, Split is usually assimilated to the search for a shortest path in a directed acyclic graph G and solved in O(nB) using Bellman׳s algorithm, where n is the number of delivery points and B is the average number of feasible routes that start with a given customer in the giant tour. Some linear-time algorithms are also known for this problem as a consequence of a Monge property of G. In this paper, we highlight a stronger property of this graph, leading to a simple alternative algorithm in O(n). Experimentally, we observe that the approach is faster than the classical Split for problem instances of practical size. We also extend the method to deal with a limited fleet and soft capacity constraints.}

  author: ["Thierry Gautier", "João V. F. Lima"]
  date: 2020-05-14
  abstract: "In the last ten years, GPUs have dominated the market considering the computing/power metric and numerous research works have provided Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms implementations accelerated on GPUs. Several software libraries have been developed for exploiting performance of systems with accelerators, but the real performance may be far from the platform peak performance. This paper presents XKBlas that aims to improve performance of BLAS-3 kernels on multi-GPU systems. At low level, we model computation as a set of tasks accessing data on different resources. At high level, the API design favors non-blocking calls as uniform concept to overlap latency, even by fine grain computation. Unit benchmark of BLAS-3 kernels showed that XKBlas outperformed most implementations including the overhead of dynamic task's creation and scheduling. XKBlas outperformed BLAS implementations such as cuBLAS-XT, PaRSEC, BLASX and Chameleon/StarPU."

  author: ["Richard Fabian"]
  abstract: "The projects tackled by the software development industry have grown in scale and complexity. Costs are increasing along with the number of developers. Power bills for distributed projects have reached the point where optimisations pay literal dividends. Over the last 10 years, a software development movement has gained traction, a movement founded in games development. The limited resources and complexity of the software and hardware needed to ship modern game titles demanded a different approach. Data-oriented design is inspired by high-performance computing techniques, database design, and functional programming values. It provides a practical methodology that reduces complexity while improving performance of both your development team and your product. Understand the goal, understand the data, understand the hardware, develop the solution. This book presents foundations and principles helping to build a deeper understanding of data-oriented design. It provides instruction on the thought processes involved when considering data as the primary detail of any project."

  abstract: "Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for the numerical solution of partial differential equations have enjoyed considerable success because they are both flexible and robust: They allow arbitrary unstructured geometries and easy control of accuracy without compromising simulation stability. Lately, another property of DG has been growing in importance: The majority of a DG operator is applied in an element-local way, with weak penalty-based element-to-element coupling. The resulting locality in memory access is one of the factors that enables DG to run on off-the-shelf, massively parallel graphics processors (GPUs). In addition, DG’s high-order nature lets it require fewer data points per represented wavelength and hence fewer memory accesses, in exchange for higher arithmetic intensity. Both of these factors work significantly in favor of a GPU implementation of DG. Using a single US$400 Nvidia GTX 280 GPU, we accelerate a solver for Maxwell’s equations on a general 3D unstructured grid by a factor of around 50 relative to a serial computation on a current-generation CPU. In many cases, our algorithms exhibit full use of the device’s available memory bandwidth. Example computations achieve and surpass 200gigaflops/s of net application-level floating point work. In this article, we describe and derive the techniques used to reach this level of performance. In addition, we present comprehensive data on the accuracy and runtime behavior of the method."

  title: GPU-accelerated sparse matrix-vector product for a hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin method
  date: 2011
  description: "The iterative solution of the large systems of equations that result from discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretizations require the ability to carry out fast matrix-vector products. DG matrices have a sparse block structure with a constant number of non-zero equal-sized non-overlapping blocks per row. General-purpose sparse matrix-vector product algorithms are not designed to exploit the specic structure of the DG matrices and, as a consequence, result in sub-optimal performance. To address this issue, we propose a sparse matrix-vector product for DG discretizations based on a dense tensor contraction. A GPU implementation of the proposed algorithm for a hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method is tested on the NVIDIA GEFORCE GTX 285. The results show that the tensor contraction performs at about 20 to 25 GFLOP/s in double precision with a sustained eciency of more than 40 percent (60 GBytes/s) of the peak memory bandwidth (160 GBytes/s). Moreover, for HDG matrices in double precision, the proposed method is 2 times faster than the general sparse matrix-vector products provided by the GPU library CUSPARSE and about 30 times faster than MATLAB running on a CPU."

  abstract: "As fusion energy devices advance, plasma simulations play a critical role in fusion reactor design. Particle-in-Cell Monte Carlo simulations are essential for modeling plasma-material interactions and analyzing power load distributions on tokamak divertors. Previous work (Williams, 2024) introduced hybrid parallelization in BIT1 using MPI and OpenMP/OpenACC for shared-memory and multicore CPU processing. In this extended work, we integrate MPI with OpenMP and OpenACC, focusing on asynchronous multi-GPU programming with OpenMP Target Tasks using the “nowait” and “depend” clauses, and OpenACC Parallel with the “async(n)” clause. Our results show significant performance improvements: 16 MPI ranks plus OpenMP threads reduced simulation runtime by 53% on a petascale EuroHPC supercomputer, while the OpenACC multicore implementation achieved a 58% reduction compared to the MPI-only version. Scaling to 64 MPI ranks, OpenACC outperformed OpenMP, achieving a 24% improvement in the particle mover function. On the HPE Cray EX supercomputer, OpenMP and OpenACC consistently reduced simulation times, with a 37% reduction at 100 nodes. Results from MareNostrum 5, a pre-exascale EuroHPC supercomputer, highlight OpenACC’s effectiveness, with the “async(n)” configuration delivering notable performance gains. However, OpenMP asynchronous configurations outperform OpenACC at larger node counts, particularly for extreme scaling runs. As BIT1 scales asynchronously to 128 GPUs, OpenMP asynchronous multi-GPU configurations outperformed OpenACC in runtime, demonstrating superior scalability, which continues up to 400 GPUs, further improving runtime. Speedup and parallel efficiency (PE) studies reveal OpenMP asynchronous multi-GPU achieving an 8.77× speedup (54.81% PE) and OpenACC achieving an 8.14× speedup (50.87% PE) on MareNostrum 5, surpassing the CPU-only version. At higher node counts, PE declined across all implementations due to communication and synchronization costs. However, the asynchronous multi-GPU versions maintained better PE, demonstrating the benefits of asynchronous multi-GPU execution in reducing scalability bottlenecks. While the CPU-only implementation is faster in some cases, OpenMP’s asynchronous multi-GPU approach delivers better GPU performance through asynchronous data transfer and task dependencies, ensuring data consistency and avoiding race conditions. Using NVIDIA Nsight tools, we confirmed BIT1’s overall efficiency for large-scale plasma simulations, leveraging current and future exascale supercomputing infrastructures. Asynchronous data transfers and dedicated GPU assignments to MPI ranks enhance performance, with OpenMP’s asynchronous multi-GPU implementation utilizing OpenMP Target Tasks with “nowait” and “depend” clauses outperforming other configurations. This makes OpenMP the preferred application programming interface when performance portability, high throughput, and efficient GPU utilization are critical. This enables BIT1 to fully exploit modern supercomputing architectures, advancing fusion energy research. MareNostrum 5 brings us closer to achieving exascale performance."

  abstract: "The paper describes some very early experiments on new architectures that support the hybrid programming model. Our results are promising in that OpenMP threads interact with MPI as desired, allowing OpenMP-agnostic tools to be used. We explore three environments: a 'typical Linux cluster, a new large-scale machine from SiCortex, and the new IBM BG/P, which have quite different compilers and runtime systems for both OpenMP and MPI. We look at a few simple, diagnostic programs, and one 'application-like' test program. We demonstrate the use of a tool that can examine the detailed sequence of events in a hybrid program and illustrate that a hybrid computation might not always proceed as expected."

  title: Adjoint-state method for Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin discretization, application to the inverse acoustic wave problem
  date: 2020
  author: ["Florian Faucher", "Otmar Scherzer"]
  abstract: "In this paper, we perform non-linear minimization using the Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin method (HDG) for the discretization of the forward problem, and implement the adjoint-state method for the efficient computation of the functional derivatives. Compared to continuous and discontinuous Galerkin discretizations, HDG reduces the computational cost by using the numerical traces for the global linear system, hence removing the degrees of freedom that are inside the cells. It is particularly attractive for large-scale time-harmonic quantitative inverse problems which make repeated use of the forward discretization as they rely on an iterative minimization procedure. HDG is based upon two levels of linear problems: a global system to find the solution on the boundaries of the cells, followed by local systems to construct the solution inside. This technicality requires a careful derivation of the adjoint-state method, that we address in this paper. We work with the acoustic wave equations in the frequency domain and illustrate with a three-dimensional experiment using partial reflection-data, where we further employ the features of DG-like methods to efficiently handle the topography with p-adaptivity."

  abstract: "Fortran remains one of the principal programming languages used in high-performance scientific, numerical, and engineering computing. The language as defined by its most recent standards, with their introduction of object-oriented programming and of coarrays, is often referred to generically as ‘Modern Fortran’, and this term is increasingly used in the literature. Thus, we see that Fortran’s particular advantages as a high-end numerical language, especially where arrays are the main form of data object and/or where complex arithmetic is involved, are still to the fore. It is able to attain the highest achievable optimization, mainly because multi-dimensional arrays are ‘natural’ objects and because its pointers are highly constrained. There is every sign that Modern Fortran will continue to be used to tackle major scientific computing problems in the next decade and beyond. This third edition of Modern Fortran Explained offers, in 20 chapters, a comprehensive and uniform description of Fortran 2018. The additional features now brought by the 2023 standard, which are mostly relatively minor in nature, are described in two final chapters, the first on generic programming and the second on other new or enhanced features. This structure enables the reader to distinguish clearly between what is old and what is new. This new edition, written by experts in the field, three of whom have actively contributed to Fortran 2023, is thus a complete and authoritative description of Fortran in its latest form, with the intention that it remain the main reference work in the field."

  author: ["Anton Shterenlikht", "Luis Cebamanos"]

  abstract: "Fortran coarrays are an attractive alternative to MPI due to a familiar Fortran syntax, single sided communications and implementation in the compiler. Scaling of coarrays is compared in this work to MPI, using cellular automata (CA) 3D Ising magnetisation miniapps, built with the CASUP CA library, https://cgpack.sourceforge.io, developed by the authors. Ising energy and magnetisation were calculated with MPI_ALLREDUCE and Fortran 2018 co_sum collectives. The work was done on ARCHER (Cray XC30) up to the full machine capacity: 109,056 cores. Ping-pong latency and bandwidth results are very similar with MPI and with coarrays for message sizes from 1B to several MB. MPI halo exchange (HX) scaled better than coarray HX, which is surprising because both algorithms use pair-wise communications: MPI IRECV/ISEND/WAITALL vs Fortran sync images. Adding OpenMP to MPI or to coarrays resulted in worse L2 cache hit ratio, and lower performance in all cases, even though the NUMA effects were ruled out. This is likely because the CA algorithm is network bound at scale. This is further evidenced by the fact that very aggressive cache and inter-procedural optimisations lead to no performance gain. The sampling and tracing analysis shows good load balancing in compute in all miniapps, but imbalance in communication, indicating that the difference in performance between MPI and coarrays is likely due to parallel libraries (MPICH2 vs libpgas) and the Cray hardware specific libraries (uGNI vs DMAPP). Overall, the results look promising for coarray use beyond 100k cores. However, further coarray optimisation is needed to narrow the performance gap between coarrays and MPI."

  abstract: "A large data set consisting of about 1000 normal mode periods, 500 summary travel time observations, 100 normal mode Q values, mass and moment of inertia have been inverted to obtain the radial distribution of elastic properties, Q values and density in the Earth's interior. The data set was supplemented with a special study of 12 years of ISC phase data which yielded an additional 1.75 × 106 travel time observations for P and S waves. In order to obtain satisfactory agreement with the entire data set we were required to take into account anelastic dispersion. The introduction of transverse isotropy into the outer 220 km of the mantle was required in order to satisfy the shorter period fundamental toroidal and spheroidal modes. This anisotropy also improved the fit of the larger data set. The horizontal and vertical velocities in the upper mantle differ by 2–4%, both for P and S waves. The mantle below 220 km is not required to be anisotropic. Mantle Rayleigh waves are surprisingly sensitive to compressional velocity in the upper mantle. High Sn velocities, low Pn velocities and a pronounced low-velocity zone are features of most global inversion models that are suppressed when anisotropy is allowed for in the inversion. The Preliminary Reference Earth Model, PREM, and auxiliary tables showing fits to the data are presented."

    title: Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering
  abstract: "This work is concerned with implementing the hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method to solve the linear anisotropic elastic equation in the frequency domain. First-order formulation with the compliance tensor and Voigt notation are employed to provide a compact description of the discretized problem and flexibility with highly heterogeneous media. We further focus on the question of optimal choices of stabilization in the definition of HDG numerical traces. For this purpose, we construct a hybridized Godunov-upwind flux for anisotropic elastic media possessing three distinct wavespeeds. This stabilization removes the need to choose a scaling factor, contrary to the identity and Kelvin–Christoffel based stabilizations which are popular choices in the literature. We carry out comparisons among these families for isotropic and anisotropic material, with constant background and highly heterogeneous ones, in two and three dimensions. These experiments establish the optimality of the Godunov stabilization which can be used as a reference choice for a generic material in which different types of waves propagate."

  author: ["S. Cacace", "R. Ferretti"]
  url: "https://doi.org/10.1007/s40314-021-01716-y"
  abstract: "Using characteristics to treat advection terms in time-dependent PDEs leads to a class of schemes, e.g., semi-Lagrangian and Lagrange–Galerkin schemes, which preserve stability under large Courant numbers, and may therefore be appealing in many practical situations. Unfortunately, the need of locating the feet of characteristics may cause a serious drop of efficiency in the case of unstructured space grids, and thus prevent the use of large time-step schemes on complex geometries. In this paper, we perform an in-depth analysis of the main recipes available for characteristic location, and propose a technique to improve the efficiency of this phase, using additional information related to the advecting vector field. This results in a clear improvement of execution times in the unstructured case, thus extending the range of applicability of large time-step schemes."

  abstract: "In this paper, we analyze the main features and discuss the tuning of the algorithms for the direct solution of sparse linear systems on distributed memory computers developed in the context of a long term European research project. The algorithms use a multifrontal approach and are especially designed to cover a large class of problems. The problems can be symmetric positive definite, general symmetric, or unsymmetric matrices, both possibly rank deficient, and they can be provided by the user in several formats. The algorithms achieve high performance by exploiting parallelism coming from the sparsity in the problem and that available for dense matrices. The algorithms use a dynamic distributed task scheduling technique to accommodate numerical pivoting and to allow the migration of computational tasks to lightly loaded processors. Large computational tasks are divided into subtasks to enhance parallelism. Asynchronous communication is used throughout the solution process to efficiently overlap communication with computation.We illustrate our design choices by experimental results obtained on an SGI Origin 2000 and an IBM SP2 for test matrices provided by industrial partners in the PARASOL project."
